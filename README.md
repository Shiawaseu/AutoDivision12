Small program I made to automatically click on the hollow icons in Division 12's minigame from [Type://Soul](https://www.roblox.com/games/14067600077/)

# Showcase

# Requirements

- Python installed (Install it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/))

# Setup

- Download the program from the `releases` tab
- Extract the ZIP folder
- Run `install.bat`
- Run `start.bat`
- Switch to game and start minigame

# Disclaimer
- I am **NOT** sure if this is not rule-breaking, use at your own risk.
- This does not start a minigame for you, so it is not fully automatic.
- I do not plan to update this, feel free to create some useful PRs though.
